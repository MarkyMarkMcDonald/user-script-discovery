User Script Discovery
==========================

Sinatra + Chrome Extension


For indexing user scripts and letting users know when they're on pages with applicable scripts.

This is a work in progress. There are a few scrapers in progress. I've harvested a sample set of data from open_user_scraper.rb,but it needs to be updated to the current schema.

For playing around with the data:

$ irb -r ./db_connector
